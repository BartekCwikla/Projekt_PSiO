# Get away from HELL...

This is a final project for a Structural and Object Oriented Programming. 

To run it you will have to put /assets into a folder containing your debug and release .exe

## Instruction

Your goal is to get away from... HELL! Kill everything that is trying to keep you there. You will be able to use many guns that are awarded to you as you progress in game. We've prepared quite a few, so try them all out and pick your favourite. You can move you character using WSAD. You can shoot in 8 directions using arrows. When you receive a new weapon it will be visible in a right bottom corner of a screen.
To access those guns click weapon hotkeys (1-9). Current weapon will be highlighted yellow. If they are closing in you can use two superpowers - fireball and meteor rain (using E and R respectively). It will give you some breating room and keep you from staying there forever... Use those wisely, as cooldown on them is relatively high. During your adventure you will encounter many beings that are hunting for you. Don't let them get close, as you will take appropriate amount of damage. Your current health status can be seen in a red bar at the top of a screen. The yellow one below is experience indicator. Every four levels you will be given a new weapon to play with. Pick up green orbs from the floor to progress. If you somehow manage to survive all waves you will have to beat the BOSS. It deals a lot of damage and it has got a decent amount of health, so good luck beating that. I wouldn't say you stand a chance, but if you were to kill it... you escape. ALTHOUGH DON'T COUNT ON THAT!

## Weapons

### Gun

A basic weapon you start with. It can keep you safe until you get to the next level

You throw a fireball in the direction specified via arrows. It crashes and burns everything on it's course. You can pave the way for yourself using that.

## Enemies

### Bat

Bats are quite shy, so they spawn in a fixed minimal distance from you. They are only oscilating vertically, but they still deal damage if you walk into them.

### Vortex

Vortex doesn't deal any damage, but stil can hurt you. It pushes you, so you might just land into a group of enemies. Still can be killed though.

### Knight, Skeleton
